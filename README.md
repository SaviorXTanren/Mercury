Maitenance Enhanced and Reliable Coding Engine
          designed by Team Radirius

-------------------------------------------------------

MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on opengl. I got started by coding the batcher and adding features like vertex stacking and sound capabilities to the game library. I was off to a fun start. When I posted it, people liked it, so I expanded and even got some new friends to help me out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: to create an ultra-flexible but easy-to-use video game library that includes support for plugins.

Sincerely,
Wessles, Founder of Team Radirius

-------------------------------------------------------

We hope to expand upon this library over time and hopefully create something that everybody can use with ease. One day there will come a point where we start support for 3D graphics, one day there will come a point where we can make a full game engine out of what we have put into this library, and one day people might not even use this for general game development. We have a bright future ahead of us.
