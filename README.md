Mercury is a small game library designed to simplify the complex and shorten the tedious for both the beginning and the experienced. With it, you can use the best aspects of OpenGL in a super easy and organized way that is optimized for game programming. It's mainly built around the concept that beginners and newcomers to game development should be able to start with the basics and then move up onto a more complex plane of development with the veterans, all on the same platform.  

Mercury puts all of its effort into keeping things short and simple. The initial setup of a game consists only of making a single class; then you are done. The interface is entirely documented for easy and fast learning. Once you get started, there is nothing between you and your killer game except coding and creativity. 

Mercury is entirely built around the wishes of its users, so please do not hesitate to suggest and critique!

## Features
Mercury comes packed with just enough features built in to it to ensure that the games you make with Mercury are brilliant. These features include, but aren't limited to: a particle engine, command-line debugging, hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics, image post-processing, geometry, various audio capabilities, and a simple GUI toolkit that allows for the easy creation of graphical user interfaces. There will also be many others to come.
