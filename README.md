MERCury is a small game library designed to simplify the complex and shorten the tedious for beginners and veterans alike. With it, you can use the best aspects of OpenGL in an easy and organized way optimized for game programming. It is built around the concept that beginners should be able to start with the basics and then move up into a more complex plane of development with the veterans, all on the same platform.  

MERCury puts all of its effort into keeping things short and simple. The initial setup of a game consists only of making a single class; then you are done. The interface is entirely documented for easy and fast learning, so once you are started, there is nothing between you and your killer game but coding and creativity. 

MERCury is built around the users wishes, so do not hesitate to suggest and critique!
