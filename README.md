MERCury is a small game library designed to simplify the complex and shorten the tedious for beginners and veterans alike. With it, you can use the best aspects of OpenGL in an easy and organized way optimized for game programming. It is built around the concept that beginners should be able to start with the basics and then move up into a more complex plane of development with the veterans, all on the same platform.  

MERCury puts all of its resources into keeping things short and simple. The initial setup of a game consists only of making a single class; then you are done. The interface is entirely documented for easy and fast learning, so once you are started, there is nothing between you and the end result but coding and creativity. 

MERCury's To-Do List is driven purely by the will of the users, so if you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to ask! 

## Features
MERCury comes packed with a ton of brilliant features designed to ensure that the games you create with MERCury are amazing. These many features include a particle engine, command-line debugging, advanced hardware-accelerated OpenGL graphics, image post-processing, geometry, various audio capabilities, and a *stunning* GUI toolkit that allows for the easy creation of beautiful graphical user interfaces.
