Maitenance Enhanced and Reliable Coding Engine

MERCury is a project that I started a while back for my own education on opengl. I got started by coding the batcher and adding features like vertex stacking and sound capabilities to the game engine. I was off to a fun start. When I posted it, people liked it, so I expanded and even got some new friends to help me out! We have been working together on networking, GUI, and other fun stuffs.

Our goal is simple: to create an ultra-flexible but easy-to-use engine that can run plugins.
