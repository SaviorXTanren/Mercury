# New geometry package
### I could explain!

Hello. You're probably wondering why this package exists. The reason for it is quite simple. It started to bug me just how inaccurate the current system was in actual geometry. For example, Points are a child of the Shape class, implying that a point is a shape, when instead it is only a basic figure. The code bugged me a bit as well. Shapes are currently made up of vertices, when it should be made of the next parent up, line segments. I also will stop using degrees, and make the switch to radians.

**Overall, just expect a whole lot of improvements to the code and standardization of geometry.**

Hopefully I will finish this :P
