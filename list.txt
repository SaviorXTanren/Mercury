Official To-Do List.

Key:
[+] - Completed/Done
[=] - In Progress
[-] - Incomplete/Not Done

Here's an example of what a proper list item should look like:
'- [-] This is how to make a proper list item.'

When you add an item to the to-do list, please do not forget to add the status symbol ('[-]') to the left of it,
but not before the beginning dash. When a task is completed you should replace the dash inside the status symbol with
a plus sign like so:
'- [+] This is how to make a proper completed list item.'

To add a sub-item to the list, please add a new line and indent it to 6 spaces (from the starting point, not past the
beginning of the list item), then add the status symbol and a space. From that point you may describe the sub-item.

Here's an example of what a proper list sub-item should look like:
'- [-] This is how to make a proper list item.'
'      [-] This is how to make a proper list sub-item.'      

Please use proper grammar when adding items to the list, and to make a comment to the list do as you would do in the
Java programming language: Make a new line, indent it by 3 spaces, add two forward-slashes ('//') with one extra 
space at the end, and then add the text to your comment.

Here's an example of what a proper list comment should look like:
'- [-] This is a list item!'
'   // This is a comment!'

If you feel like doing so, you may make a comment stating who a task was completed by.

Please do not forget to keep this updated! While 'list.txt' still a document it has feelings!

Thanks for reading this gigantic block of text, sorry it was so long!
